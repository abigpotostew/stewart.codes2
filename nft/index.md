## NFTs by Stewart aka skymagic.eth

Original single edition digital art by Stewart Bracken.

Each of these pieces are rendered using a GLSL fragment shader. The videos produced are "perfect" loops-- they can be played seamlessly on repeat.

I hope you enjoy these as much as I enjoyed making them.

Equipartition, 2021
Ascending glowing spheres emerge from a viscous medium that seems to resist the rise of the spheres. The spheres also resist their own ascension by dancing upwards in unifying trepidation by merging and bobbing along their journey in a wild combination of colors.
