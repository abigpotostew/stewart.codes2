[Pure bathing culture](/categories/Pure-bathing-culture/) is a fun concept that can be taken in a philosophical direction. Taken literally it is the feeling you get when taking a bath with a bunch of good friends. It's a silly situation, without a doubt. Everyone is near naked, pushing each others boundaries, stimulating good conversation, laughter, and high vibes. Love and consent based, of course. Sexuality is on the tip of our tongues. Yet a sense of deep friendship and possibility is tangible. Immediecy is key.

Pure bathing culture (PBC) is descriptive of a situation #PBC. A particularly fun gathering was [#PBC](/tags/PBC/).

But it's also practice or personal philosophy to strive for. What else is possible in this moment? What kind of connections or new experiences can be explored right now!?

[#PBC](/tags/PBC/) is silliness and immediacy with your friends. Anything is possible.
