I'm hosting a copy of this handy game design tree dialogue editor tool. I'm currently using it to design interactive dialogue for a game I'm working on. This tool is great for my non-coding friend to design game content with.

Additionally I've developed a Lua runtime for the data files this tool produces. I'm using it with the Defold game engine: [https://github.com/abigpotostew/dialogger-lua](https://github.com/abigpotostew/dialogger-lua)
