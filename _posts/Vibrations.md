Our eyes see vibrations (photons).
Our ears hear vibrations (fluid waves).
Our noses smell molecules through a chemical interaction (vibrating atomic particles against olfactory receptor neurons)
Our bodies feel through various receptors, but I'm not sure yet how these can be classified as vibrations.

Vibration size matters:
smallest to largest:
- light (photons)
- volatile chemicals (molecule)
- fluid waves (air or liquid)
- touch (macro scale physical vibrations)
